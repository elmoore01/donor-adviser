    Donor Adviserâ„¢ safely connects individual donors with nonprofits whose missions reflect their philanthropic goals.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">Most people think of large foundations when they hear <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">philanthropy</span>, but individual donors are the lifeblood of the nonprofit sector!
