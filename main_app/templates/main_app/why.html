<hr>
<div class="container">
    <p class="lead">Because we don't just list your organization, we <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">promote</span> your organization to a much larger community of donors than one nonprofit can reach. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">Rather than competing for limited funds from a small number of foundations and corporations, our algorithims enable nonprofits to take advantage of governing dynamics. Organizations listed on Donor Adviser agree to utilize their <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">social media</span> channels to help create a community of giving that will benefit not only their nonprofit, but the entire nonprofit sector! 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">By combining an online platform that showcases and promotes the good works of nonprofits, with a collaborative effort to increase the number of qualified donors, nonprofits will be able to <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">reach more potential donors</span> than by conducting outreach on their own.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="lead">Further, by enabling and encouraging donors to cover the costs associated with processing credit card donations, we ensure nonprofits receive 100% of the total amount donated by supporters.</p>
